# Karaoke Song List App

This is a React-Rudux app that connects with a REST API to provide an interface for users to search and browse karaoke songs. This app is still in its infancy, so everything is still rough around the edges. You can see the app in action at [karaoke.lividliquid.com](https://karaoke.lividliquid.com).

## Running the Project
1. Clone or download the project and unzip it.
2. Run `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Run `npm start` and ta-da, a browser window should automatically open to localhost:3000.

## About
This project is primarily developed and maintained for [LividLiquid Productions](https://www.lividliquid.com/) in Seattle, WA, but you are free to use it for your own purposes, but please note that you are responsible for writing the backend API software.

## With Thanks
Many thanks to the [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) project for giving me a great starting point for building this project.
